Aim  :-
 The aim of a fast food ordering system project in Java would be to create a software application that allows customers to place orders for food items at a fast food restaurant using a computer or mobile device. The system should be user-friendly and provide customers with a simple and efficient way to browse the menu, select items, customize their orders, and make payments.

The system should also allow restaurant staff to manage and process orders, including receiving and processing new orders, preparing and packaging food items, and notifying customers when their orders are ready for pickup or delivery. Additionally, the system may include features such as inventory management, reporting and analytics, and integration with other systems such as point-of-sale and accounting software.

Overall, the aim of the fast food ordering system project in Java is to create a streamlined and efficient ordering process for both customers and restaurant staff, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and increased operational efficiency for the restaurant.

Objectives:-
Improve Customer Experience: The primary objective of the project is to enhance the overall customer experience by providing a user-friendly and efficient platform for placing food orders. The system should make it easy for customers to browse the menu, customize their orders, and make payments, resulting in a streamlined and convenient ordering process.
Enhance Order Accuracy: By implementing a digital ordering system, the project aims to minimize order errors and improve order accuracy. Customers can select their desired items directly from the menu, reducing miscommunication or misunderstandings that can occur during traditional order-taking methods.
Enable Easy Menu Management: The project should provide a menu management feature that allows restaurant staff to easily add, modify, or remove food items from the menu. This enables quick updates to reflect changes in available items, pricing, and promotions.
